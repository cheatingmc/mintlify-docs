    ```
    
    You'll receive a message showing:
    - Product names
    - Current prices
    - Available stock
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="API" icon="code">
    Make a GET request to the stock endpoint:

    ```
    
    <CodeGroup>
    
    ```python Python
    import requests
    
    response = requests.get(
        "https://api.nicealts.com/v1/stock",
        params={"key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
    )
    
    stock = response.json()
    for product in stock["products"]:
        print(f"{product['id']}: {product['stock']} available at {product['price']} credits")
    ```
    
    ```javascript JavaScript
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://api.nicealts.com/v1/stock?key=YOUR_API_KEY'
    );
    
    const stock = await response.json();
    stock.products.forEach(product => {
      console.log(`${product.id}: ${product.stock} available at ${product.price} credits`);
    });
    ```
